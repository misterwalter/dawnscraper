# dawnscraper
A simple tool to scrape all relevant game data from my website imperialdawn.com...because I feel like doing it this way


# Setup
This project uses `uv` to handle dependencies. Dependency. The `requests` library. Maybe more someday? Probably not?

Whatever it's muscle memory at this point.

`uv run main.py`

Keep the following command in your head when working with this, trust me:
```
rm *.json
```
